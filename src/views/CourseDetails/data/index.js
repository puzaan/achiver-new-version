      'Machine Learning is an Application of Artificial Intelligence. It provides software systems and the devices they run on an ability to collect, process and analyze data that they collect. With application of Machine Learning, devices and systems can learn continuously based on instructions provided by a programmer or autonomously. Eventually, they become able to make accurate predictions devoid of human bias.',

      'Machine Learning is a first-class ticket to the most exciting careers in data analysis today. As data sources proliferate along with the computing power to process them, going straight to the data is one of the most straightforward ways to quickly gain insights and make predictions.',
      'Machine Learning (ML) is basically that field of computer science with the help of which computer systems can provide sense to data in much the same way as human beings do. In simple words, ML is a type of artificial intelligence that extract patterns out of raw data by using an algorithm or method. The key focus of ML is to allow computer systems to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed or human intervention.',
